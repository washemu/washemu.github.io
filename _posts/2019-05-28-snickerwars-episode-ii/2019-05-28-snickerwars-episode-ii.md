Soooo, despite the optimistic tone of last week's post, it looks like I'm going
to be forced to take a hiatus from WashingtonDC, which means that I won't be
able to release in time for the 20th anniversary of 9/9/99.  I found out over
the weekend that I have a tumor growing in my leg, and a Deep Vein Thrombosis
(DVT) that was formed because the tumor is compressing a blood vein.  I don't
know if the tumor is cancerous or not yet, but even if it's benign the DVT
could still kill me by dislodging and causing a stroke.  I'm in a lot of pain,
and I'm not supposed to be sitting in office chairs so this means that for at
least a month (and possibly longer) I will not be making any commits to
WashingtonDC.

I'm not making this post because I'm looking for a pity-party or anything, I
just want everybody to know that the reason why the project is about to go
without updates for an extended period of time is not that it's abandoned, it's
that I'm not able to work on it for medical reasons.

When I come back, my first order of business is going to be see if I can help
out the Final Burn Neo folks with CAVE CV1000 emulation.  This will further delay
my return to WashingtonDC, but I found out they need somebody who is experienced
with SH and I am such a person and this sounds like a fascinating project to
be involved with.

I'm also going to be uploading to github a copy of WashingtonDC's SH4 and JIT
code relicensed in a way which is compatible with FBN's license so somebody else
can use it as a basis for SH3 emulation in case I don't survive.  I don't think
I'm going to die, but there is a tangible possibility that I will so I need to
be prepared for that.

Look up "Puzzle! Mushihimetama" if you want to know why I'm fascinated by the
cv1k; its a puzzle game where you help a cute anime character with large
bouncing titties rescue beetles by matching up groups of colored rocks that you
launch into the playing area with a plunger.  I got to play it at 2018's
California Extreme arcade convention, and it was my favorite game of the show.
It's really cute.
