Long story short: sometimes doctors over-estimate how serious something is, and
it turns out that the combination tumor/blood-clot from the last post is
actually something far less life-threatening than what was initially believed.
So it looks like I'll be getting back to work on WashingtonDC sooner rather
than later.

Might still be a bit more of a hiatus, though.  Just because my leg isn't about
to kill me anymore doesn't mean that my leg doesn't still hurt like a bitch.
And then there's still that CAVE 1000 stuff.
